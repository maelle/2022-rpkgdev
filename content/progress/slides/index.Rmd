# How to improve your R package

Automatically ‚ú®, and not üß†

---

# Workflow automation tools

:robot:

---

## Assessing your package

* [R CMD check or `devtools::check()`](http://r-pkgs.org/check.html), [BiocCheck](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocCheck.html)

* [pkgcheck](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/), [goodpractice](http://mangothecat.github.io/goodpractice/), [lintr](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) (possibly via [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io)).



* [`covr::package_coverage()`](http://covr.r-lib.org/reference/package_coverage.html)



* [`devtools::spell_check()`](http://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/spell_check.html)

---

## Improve metrics by hand?!

Yes and no!

```
---

## Tools for improving



* [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/). Better paired with [version control](https://happygitwithr.com/).



* [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html) NAMESPACE generation. Switching: [`Rd2roxygen`](https://yihui.org/rd2roxygen/).



* [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). Work on reference index & navbar!



* `usethis` e.g. [`usethis::use_test()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#section-package-development).

---

## When and where to use the tools?

Right after my talk (not now üòú), but then?


```{=html}
{{< figure src="photo-of-planner-and-writing-materials-760710.jpg" alt="Planner" caption="Picture by [Bich Tran](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-planner-and-writing-materials-760710/)" width=300 >}}
```

## Continuous integration

**Run something every time you make a change**

> "The idea behind continuous integration is that CI will automatically run R CMD check (along with your tests, etc.) every time you push a commit to GitHub. You don't have to remember to do this; CI automatically checks the code after every commit."
[Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/)

GitHub Actions, Circle CI, [`tic` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/tic/)...

## Continuous integration

How to learn?

[Julia Silge's post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/) - [Jim Hester's GitHub Actions talk](https://www.jimhester.com/talk/2020-rsc-github-actions/) - [`usethis` helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#section-continuous-integration)

`r hugodown::embed_tweet("1205183124868681728")`

---

## More with continuous integration

Couple a thing (R CMD check? pkgdown site building?) to 

... each commit,

... every Monday,

... applying a label to a pull request?

---

## Pre-commit


```{=html}
{{< figure src="mara.jpg" alt="Tired: Always remember to do things well. Wired: Use continuous integration to notice wrong stuff" caption="Illustration by [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1255510799273132032)" width=400 >}}
```

---

## Pre-commit

[`precommit` R package](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/) -- Python [precommit framework](https://pre-commit.com/)

* Setup hooks

* Hooks for styling, parsable R code, spell checks, etc.

---

## Pre-commit

ü§´ You can still skip the checks.

---

## Check things before show time


CRAN release! üêâ Checks on different platforms, URLs, spell checks...

* [submission checklist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html)

* [`usethis::use_release_issue()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html) creating a GitHub issue with important items.

* or [`devtools::release()` function](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/blob/b166195be72927a003e6937de5c3239881095a9f/R/release.R#L39)

## Improve workflow vs. procrastinate

Risk of spending too much time on [meta-work](https://youtu.be/dIjKJjzRX_E?t=633).

As a beginner, easier to create good habits. :wink:

#     Reading code & about code


---

## Why read source code

* You want to know what is going on.

* You want to build on the function/package for your own goals.

* You're just curious. 

* You need examples of a thing in the wild.

---

## How to read source code

* [`lookup` package](https://github.com/jimhester/lookup#readme)

* [GitHub search](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-searching-on-github)

* Mirrors of [CRAN packages](https://github.com/cran) and [R-source](https://github.com/wch/r-source), on GitHub.

---

## Reading code...

And trying things out!

Fork, clone, and explore!

## rOpenSci Software Peer Review

[Transparent, constructive, non adversarial and open review process](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#whatissoftwarereview) for packages [in scope](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#aims-and-scope). 

Also [rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/stat-software-review/).

Interesting for authors, and reviewers!

[Online book of best practice](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) for the reviews and package development.
