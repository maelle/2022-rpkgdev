# How to find your happy place in the world of R package development

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why contribute to open-source?

-   Enjoy it?

-   Giving back?

-   Skill development?

-   Exposure?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R package development?

There are other ways to contribute including community building.

This slidedeck focuses on R package development. :wink:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Find your happy place

Especially is open-source work happens in your free time.

Right amount of time, right task fit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your package(s)

Interactions with users and contributors!

Both rewarding and time-consuming

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Make your repo a friendly place

-   Contributing guide (what are your expectations?)

-   Code of Conduct

-   Governance file?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Others' packages?

-   A way for you to start

-   A way for you to concentrate on your strengths

-   What you actually want to do!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Others' packages

-   First watch development and interactions, read contributing guide.

-   Start interacting in the repo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Others' packages

What packages? Packages...

-   ... that you use

-   ... corresponding to your skillset or skills you want to learn

-   ... that have room for external contributions

-   ... where your work is valued!

## Others' packages

Now often your name won't be on it, maybe only in the changelog.

How to still display your skills? Blogging, talks?

## Disclaimer

This was a very brief presentation, and a complex topic.
